FLOAT TEST
by Jacek Burys, Imperial College London, UROP 2015

FloatTest is an extension to CSmith which allows to represent float variables as intervals.
Use --float-test option to generate FloatTest programs.
It could find use in testing of floating point optimizations by running the program in two different modes:
- normal mode - on default programs generated with --float-test options behave almost exactly like normal programs generated with CSmith, the difference is increased probablility of creating float variables and operations,
- float-test mode - when the program is compiled with -DFLOAT_TEST_ENABLED it will use intervals to represent float variables, we have also provided an adapter for Boost Interval Library which is used to perform interval arithmetics oerations,
